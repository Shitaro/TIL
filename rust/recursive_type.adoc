= Recursive type without indirection is illigal

== Cause

Recursive type has infinite size.

This is an example:
[source, rust]
----
enum Tree<T> {
    EmptyTree,
    Node {
        value: T,
        l: Tree<T>,
        r: Tree<T>
    }
}
----

The size of this struct is the sum:
[source, rust]
----
size_of::<Tree<T>> == hoge + size_of::<Tree<T>>
----

That is, the size is infinite.

== Remedy

Put  in a `Box<T>`:

[source, rust]
----
enum Tree<T> {
    EmptyTree,
    Node {
        value: T,
        l: Box<Tree<T>>,
        r: Box<Tree<T>>
    }
}
----

A `Box<T>` is a pointer, i.e., it has a fixed size.
